<h1>Oxford University SIAM <br />Student Chapter</h1>

<p>
The University of Oxford SIAM Student Chapter is a fast-growing society devoted to facilitating engagement between the University of Oxfordâ€™s international applied mathematics community and industry through conferences, workshops, competitions, prizes and other events. In this way, the Chapter provides a specialised forum in which the finest mathematicians can share a common interest in applied mathematics, scientific computing and industrial applications. The Chapter was founded in January 2008 by a small group of enthusiastic students. We are now one of the largest chapters worldwide with members including undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, faculty and industrial partners. The Chapter is kindly supported by <a href="https://www.wintoncapital.com/">Winton Capital</a> and <a href="http://www.marketsentinel.com/">Market Sentinel</a>.
  
Our goals include:
<ul>
  <li>Providing a forum in which students and faculty members can share their interest in applied mathematics and scientific computing.</li>
  <li>Organising internal seminars and workshops for researchers to present their work, and arranging social functions in Oxford at which members can interact in an informal setting.</li>
  <li>Engaging Oxford University members in SIAM's international community through the conferences, competitions, prizes and other opportunities offered by SIAM.</li>
  <li>Establishing links with industrial partners.</li>
</ul>
